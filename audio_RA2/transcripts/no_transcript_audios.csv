./audio_RA2/Zofia/SovietWar/RA2_csofu39.mp3,,,Yuri's Boomer submarine combines the stuff of a sub with a ballistic capabilities of our own dreadknots. Our squids are the only unit that can effectively counter them.,
./audio_RA2/Zofia/SovietWar/RA2_csofu40.mp3,,,"Commander, this unit is the strongest Yuri has. He's the brute and he can smash things with minimal effort",
./audio_RA2/Zofia/SovietWar/RA2_csofu41.mp3,,,Unfortunately the chaos drone was a promising Soviet design that Yuri stole. It produces a cloud of hallucinogenic gas that causes all those affected to go berserk for a limited time period.,
./audio_RA2/Zofia/SovietWar/RA2_csofu42.mp3,,,Yuri is running his war mostly on stolen Soviet technology maintained by Soviet defectors. His engineers may have worked for us once but they have joined Yuri now. Shoot them on sight.,
./audio_RA2/Zofia/SovietWar/RA2_csofu43.mp3,,,"Beware of these floating discs, Comrade General. Yuri has designed them to be able to drain power from our Tesla and nuclear reactors, as well as our own defensive buildings. And if they get near refinery, they are even better thefts than the accursed Allied spies.",
./audio_RA2/Zofia/SovietWar/RA2_csofu44.mp3,,,"The Gatling tank is an impressive machine. Its guns can effectively target both air and land targets. The fire rate increases over time as their main guns get up to speed, so it is best dealt with by quick precision strikes.",
./audio_RA2/Zofia/SovietWar/RA2_csofu45.mp3,,,"This is Yuri's hover transport, Commander.",
./audio_RA2/Zofia/SovietWar/RA2_csofu46.mp3,,,"Yuri calls his foot soldiers Initiates. They attack with a powerful psychic blast. Effective against infantry, but not much else.",
./audio_RA2/Zofia/SovietWar/RA2_csofu47.mp3,,,"We suspect Yuri stole the plans for the Lasher tank from our research department. But don't worry, Commander. We abandoned the project because the tank was too weak.",
./audio_RA2/Zofia/SovietWar/RA2_csofu48.mp3,,,"Sir, Yuri is deploying a new unit called the Magnetron. It can generate a powerful electromagnetic field that can drag our tanks towards it.",
./audio_RA2/Zofia/SovietWar/RA2_csofu49.mp3,,,This thing is Yuri's master mind. It can take control of our units just as Yuri himself can. We have discovered its weakness though. It can only control so many of our units before it overloads itself and is destroyed.,
./audio_RA2/Zofia/SovietWar/RA2_csofu50.mp3,,,Yuri's construction vehicle is a slightly modified version of our own. It of course deploys into a construction yard on command.,
./audio_RA2/Zofia/SovietWar/RA2_csofu51.mp3,,,"Yuri liberated a Soviet prison early in the war, but the prisoners soon discovered that they were better off in theirselves. Now they are forced to gather ore for Yuri until they drop from exhaustion or worse.",
./audio_RA2/Zofia/SovietWar/RA2_csofu52.mp3,,,"Yuri has no need for a refinery because the slave miner is manned by a crew of slaves who refined the ore inside the vehicle. Without these vehicles, Yuri's production would slow to a crawl.",
./audio_RA2/Zofia/SovietWar/RA2_csofu53.mp3,,,The Virus is a lethal group of female snipers. We tried to recruit them once but they refused. Apparently you remade them an offer they could not refuse.,
./audio_RA2/Zofia/SovietWar/RA2_csofu54.mp3,,,"Without his clones, Yuri would not have made it this far. Wipe out these abominations for the good of Mother Russia.",
./audio_RA2/Zofia/SovietWar/RA2_csofu55.mp3,,,"I doubt we'll see that coward Yuri on the battlefield, but if he's spotted, he must be removed for the good of everyone.",
./audio_RA2/Zofia/SovietWar/RA2_csofu56.mp3,,,This is Yuri's barracks.,
./audio_RA2/Zofia/SovietWar/RA2_csofu57.mp3,,,This is Yuri's battle lab.,
./audio_RA2/Zofia/SovietWar/RA2_csofu58.mp3,,,The hideous design of the bioreactor requires that people be placed inside in suspended animation for it to achieve maximum power. Destroy them whenever possible.,
./audio_RA2/Zofia/SovietWar/RA2_csofu59.mp3,,,Yuri believes that the strongest citadel walls will stop the hand of vengeance. Show him that they will not.,
./audio_RA2/Zofia/SovietWar/RA2_csofu60.mp3,,,"Yuri's cloning vats create a duplicate unit for everyone that comes out of his barracks. Given enough time, he can produce an overwhelming horde and overrun our position. Stop his efforts quickly, Comrade.",
./audio_RA2/Zofia/SovietWar/RA2_csofu61.mp3,,,Yuri's Gatling cannon can stop large sorts of air or land units. Destroy them from beyond their firing range if possible.,
./audio_RA2/Zofia/SovietWar/RA2_csofu62.mp3,,,"Yuri does not take prisoners. He feeds them into his grinder to produce additional resources. Do not let our men be captured, Comrade General.",
./audio_RA2/Zofia/SovietWar/RA2_csofu63.mp3,,,Yuri took his psychic sensor from us when he betrayed the Soviet Union. He has modified it to reveal any location on the battlefield he chooses.,
./audio_RA2/Zofia/SovietWar/RA2_csofu64.mp3,,,"Comrade General, this is a psychic tower. When units get within its firing range, they become mindless slaves to Yuri. Once units are taken, the only way to get them back is to destroy the tower or cut the power.",
./audio_RA2/Zofia/SovietWar/RA2_csofu65.mp3,,,"This is Yuri's submarine pen. Without it, Yuri cannot produce Boomer subs or hover transports.",
./audio_RA2/Zofia/SovietWar/RA2_csofu66.mp3,,,Yuri's weak Lasher tanks need additional defenses to be effective. The tank bunker allows the tank's turret to fire while the tank itself remains inside a protective structure. Crock the bunker from long-range if possible and then deal with the tank inside.,
./audio_RA2/Zofia/SovietWar/RA2_csofu67.mp3,,,"This is Yuri's ore factory, Sir.",
./audio_RA2/Zofia/SovietWar/RA2_csofu68.mp3,,,"The force shield defense system was originally designed by the Allies to stop our nuclear attacks, but Yuri stole their technology and then we stole it from one of Yuri's clumsy initiates. The arms race continues.",
./audio_RA2/Zofia/SovietWar/RA2_csofu69.mp3,,,Yuri's genetic mutator can transform our loyal Soviet troops into freakish brutes that serve only Yuri. The transformation is permanent. Death is the only release from this horror.,
./audio_RA2/Zofia/SovietWar/RA2_csofu70.mp3,,,"The psychic dominator is the ultimate extension of Yuri's psychic power. They are not currently at full power, so they can only dominate the minds of relatively small groups of our soldiers. But if we don't stop him, Yuri will use the dominator to control the world.",
./audio_RA2/Zofia/SovietWar/RA2_csofu71.mp3,,,"Commander, this new Allied toy is called a Battle Fortress. This rolling monstrosity will crush even our tanks while the men inside rain fire out its many gun ports.",
./audio_RA2/Zofia/SovietWar/RA2_csofu72.mp3,,,"You may remember the Korean Black Eagle fighters from our last encounter. They are effective in destroying our key production facilities, so be sure to have plenty of flak waiting for them when they arrive.",
./audio_RA2/Zofia/SovietWar/RA2_csofu73.mp3,,,The Allies developed the Force Shield defense system to stop our nukes. It would be wise to destroy it before a nuclear assault.,
./audio_RA2/Zofia/SovietWar/RA2_csofu74.mp3,,,"The Allied Grand Cannon is an effective defense turret, but it has one weakness. It has a minimum-range umbrella. If you can get troops next to the cannon inside its umbrella, they can destroy the turret without fear of return fire.",
./audio_RA2/Zofia/SovietWar/RA2_csofu75.mp3,,,The Allies has been equipping some of their GIs with anti-tank weapons. These new Guardian GIs are the first real threat to our tanks the Allies has produced. Maybe our dogs would like to meet them.,
./audio_RA2/Zofia/SovietWar/RA2_csofu76.mp3,,,Allied paratroopers have a nasty habit of dropping into the back of our bases where defenses are weak. Be sure to keep some dogs on there ready to deal with them.,
./audio_RA2/Zofia/SovietWar/RA2_csofu77.mp3,,,"If you destroy the robot control center, all of the enemy's robot tanks will be rendered useless.",
./audio_RA2/Zofia/SovietWar/RA2_csofu78.mp3,,,The Allies are developing more robotic technology to deal with Yuri's mind control. The robot tank can be dealt with by direct fire or by destroying the robot control center.,
./audio_RA2/Zofia/SovietWar/RA2_csofu79.mp3,,,The Allied sniper is lethal against our infantry. Locate snipers quickly and send in armor to deal with them.,
./audio_RA2/Zofia/SovietWar/RA2_csofu80.mp3,,,The Allied tank destroyer is one of the only threat to our Apocalypse tanks. Deal with the tank destroyers quickly or expect heavy losses in our armored divisions.,
./audio_RA2/Zofia/SovietWar/RA2_csofu81.mp3,,,The battle bunker can protect our conscripts while they fight. Enemy tanks cannot stand against our defenses.,
./audio_RA2/Zofia/SovietWar/RA2_csofu82.mp3,,,"This is Boris, Comrade General. He's equipped with superior weapons and has full authority to call in an airstrike. He's one of our finest soldiers and a hero to the Soviet people.",
./audio_RA2/Zofia/SovietWar/RA2_csofu83.mp3,,,"This is the demo truck. It's a truck loaded with explosives. Get the truck into an enemy base and when they destroy it, it will explode causing major damage to their base.",
./audio_RA2/Zofia/SovietWar/RA2_csofu85.mp3,,,Our borrowed Force Shield defense system will help defend against the Allied weather storm attack. Hopefully it will also protect us against Yuri's mass destruction weapons.,
./audio_RA2/Zofia/SovietWar/RA2_csofu86.mp3,,,"Sir, if you build and deploy our new industrial plant, you'll be able to produce our units much more quickly and efficiently.",
./audio_RA2/Zofia/SovietWar/RA2_csofu87.mp3,,,"Yuri had the research team developing a cosmonaut version of the Allied rocketeer, so we finished the design. I only wish I knew what Yuri's plans for space were.",
./audio_RA2/Zofia/SovietWar/RA2_csofu88.mp3,,,"The siege chopper can target enemies from the air, but its main weapon can only be deployed from a ground position. A mobile turret has many tactical advantages. Wouldn't you agree, Comrade General?",
./audio_RA2/Zofia/SovietWar/RA2_csofu89.mp3,,,It is obvious now that we relied too heavily on Yuri's technologies. The spy plane will help combat the loss of Yuri's information network.,
./audio_RA2/Zofia/SovietWar/RA2_csofu90.mp3,,,The Cuban terrorist is ready to die for our cause. Use his bomb against enemy buildings. Don't let his sacrifice be in vain.,
./audio_RA2/Zofia/SovietWar/RA2_csofu91.mp3,,,Our experimental Tesla tank is finally ready for field use. It is a natural extension of the Tesla technology.,
./audio_RA2/Zofia/SovietWar/RA2_csofu92.mp3,,,Capture civilian hospitals whenever they are found in the field. They will provide medical supplies to keep our troops fit to fight longer.,
./audio_RA2/Zofia/SovietWar/RA2_csofu93.mp3,,,Machine shops can maintain our vehicles in the field and repair any damage over time.,
./audio_RA2/Zofia/SovietWar/RA2_csofu94.mp3,,,"Yuri apparently had a network of secret labs all over the globe, developing technologies for his private war. Capture these labs whenever you find them. Who knows what secrets lie within.",
,,./audio_RA2/Others/SovietWar/RA2_s01_p01.mp3,"Yuri's forces are seizing power generating plants in order to activate the psychic dominator on Alcatraz Island. Our forces are here. If you wish to successfully capture the American time travel machine, it would be wise to move quickly.",
,,./audio_RA2/Others/SovietWar/RA2_s01_p03.mp3,"We would not have had another chance. We have arrived in San Francisco and the time of the first Soviet occupation. The psychic dominator is still under construction on Alcatraz Island. You must subdue Yuri's forces and get Boris, our special Commander, within citing range of the device. Once there, he will be able to call in an airstrike.",
,,./audio_RA2/Others/SovietWar/RA2_s02_p01.mp3,"But then we did not have you to lead us, Comrade General. This time you must destroy Einstein's lab.",
,,./audio_RA2/Others/SovietWar/RA2_s03_p01.mp3,"Across the river, Yuri is using a psychic beacon to control an Allied base. If you can destroy the psychic beacon, the Allied troops will join us in battle.",
,,./audio_RA2/Others/SovietWar/RA2_s04_p01.mp3,We believe that Premier Romanov is hiding in the eastern part of the city. You must transport him safely across the river to the airport. Yuri's forces have garrisoned buildings to the North. Our new demolition truck should be able to clear those structures.,
,,./audio_RA2/Others/SovietWar/RA2_s05_p01.mp3,"Yuri has constructed some type of technical facility on the island. We do not know its purpose. The island's terrain will make an attack difficult. High cliff walls surround the center of the island. You must choose your landing zone very carefully, Comrade General.",
,,./audio_RA2/Others/SovietWar/RA2_s06_p02.mp3,"Our infantry must wear cosmonaut suits. These are equipped with lasers and rocket packs. Yuri's base is north of our position. Good luck, Comrade General.",
,,./audio_RA2/Others/SovietWar/RA2_s07_p01.mp3,"Its location is directly north of your present position. Unfortunately, Allied troops to the west and Soviet troops to the east are both under the control of Yuri's psychic beacons. Destroy the beacons, and they will join you in battle.",
./audio_RA2/Zofia/SovietWar/RA2_xs3so03.mp3,,,"Entrenched defenses ahead, General. Alert the troops.",
,./audio_RA2/Yuri/SovietWar/RA2_xs4yu01.mp3,,You have only succeeded in delaying the inevitable. I will win.,
,./audio_RA2/Yuri/SovietWar/RA2_xs4yu02.mp3,,"I know what your tactics are, General. And I can tell you they won't work.",
,./audio_RA2/Yuri/SovietWar/RA2_xs4yu03.mp3,,"General, I suggest you leave this area. Or you will suffer the same fate as Premier Romanov.",
,./audio_RA2/Yuri/SovietWar/RA2_xs4yu04.mp3,,You can only hide so long before you're discovered by my followers.,
,./audio_RA2/Yuri/SovietWar/RA2_xs4yu05.mp3,,"Come to me, Premier Romanov. I will protect you.",
./audio_RA2/Zofia/SovietWar/RA2_xs5so01.mp3,,,"We are nearing the island, Commander. I see three possible landing zones.",
./audio_RA2/Zofia/SovietWar/RA2_xs5so02.mp3,,,Here.,
./audio_RA2/Zofia/SovietWar/RA2_xs5so03.mp3,,,Here.,
./audio_RA2/Zofia/SovietWar/RA2_xs5so04.mp3,,,And here.,
./audio_RA2/Zofia/SovietWar/RA2_xs5so05.mp3,,,Yuri submarine base should be here.,
./audio_RA2/Zofia/SovietWar/RA2_xs5so06.mp3,,,"We've direct access here, but it will be heavily defended. Without a large naval force, this route would be suicide.",
./audio_RA2/Zofia/SovietWar/RA2_xs5so07.mp3,,,We've also had intermittent contact with Yuri's Boomer submarines at this locations.,
./audio_RA2/Zofia/SovietWar/RA2_xs5so08.mp3,,,I suggest sending the squids out in front of the main group.,
./audio_RA2/Zofia/SovietWar/RA2_xs5so09.mp3,,,SWEET STALIN! Yuri has turned those monuments into weapons!,
./audio_RA2/Zofia/SovietWar/RA2_xs5so10.mp3,,,"Commander, you may want to use the Iron Curtain to help defeat the enemy's more fortified positions.",
./audio_RA2/Zofia/SovietWar/RA2_xs5so11.mp3,,,Perhaps an engineer could wire this statue to work for us.,
./audio_RA2/Zofia/SovietWar/RA2_xs5so12.mp3,,,"Sir, we are extremely vulnerable here. I suggest you built and deploy our new siege choppers. Their deployment weapon will help fortify our location.",
./audio_RA2/Zofia/SovietWar/RA2_xs5so13.mp3,,,"Look out, Sir. We are getting strange power readings from those statues.",
./audio_RA2/Zofia/SovietWar/RA2_xs5so14.mp3,,,What could this be? We should take a closer look after we destroy Yuri's submarine pen.,
,./audio_RA2/Yuri/SovietWar/RA2_xs5yu01.mp3,,"No! Well, now you have done it, I fear we can no longer be friends.",
,./audio_RA2/Yuri/SovietWar/RA2_xs5yu02.mp3,,"Your efforts have been amusing up to now, but if you destroy this base, I will destroy you.",
./audio_RA2/Zofia/SovietWar/RA2_xs6so01.mp3,,,"Sir, Yuri is deploying a new unit called the Magnetron. It can generate a powerful electromagnetic field that can drag our tanks toward it.",
./audio_RA2/Zofia/SovietWar/RA2_xs6so02.mp3,,,"Comrade General, to the east there is open ground suitable for base construction, but be warned. Our operatives report that Yuri has more than one base in the area.",
./audio_RA2/Zofia/SovietWar/RA2_xs6so03.mp3,,,"They're the resources on this airless rock, Comrade General. You must make the best of the funds you already have. Good luck.",
./audio_RA2/Zofia/SovietWar/RA2_xs6so04.mp3,,,"Well done, Comrade General. Victory will soon be ours.",
,./audio_RA2/Yuri/SovietWar/RA2_xs6yu01.mp3,,"So, you discovered my little hideaway. No one will hear you scream so far from earth.",
,./audio_RA2/Yuri/SovietWar/RA2_xs6yu02.mp3,,I sense your cash reserves are almost depleted.,
./audio_RA2/Zofia/SovietWar/RA2_xs7so01.mp3,,,"Commander, be advised that Yuri is combining his own forces with the Soviet and Allied units that he controls to strengthen their attacks against you.",
./audio_RA2/Zofia/SovietWar/RA2_xs7so02.mp3,,,"Look, Comrade General, at back door! Perhaps if you send some engineers through to capture the psychic beacon, you might arrest control of the Soviet base from Yuri.",
./audio_RA2/Zofia/SovietWar/RA2_xs7so03.mp3,,,"Sir, if Yuri's genetic mutator is not taken, he will turn your infantry into brutes under his control.",
./audio_RA2/Zofia/SovietWar/RA2_xs7so04.mp3,,,"Commander, this group of freedom fighters is willing to join us in this final battle against Yuri. They should prove most useful.",
,./audio_RA2/Yuri/SovietWar/RA2_xs7yu01.mp3,,"A good thought, Commander. I think my puppets should follow your example and build their own super weapons. Uh hmm hmm hmm.",
,./audio_RA2/Yuri/SovietWar/RA2_xs7yu02.mp3,,"I have grown weary of waiting for you to make up your mind. Wherever you make your base, you will be unable to defend it from my forces or those of my Soviet and Allied bombs.",
