# AudioManipulation
## Initial set up!
### ffmpeg for audio processing
Installation: https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/ffmpeg-git-essentials.7z 
1. Unzip it and put the folder in the root directory--it actually doesn't 
   matter whether you put it in the root directory or not (I did it for 
   documentation)
2. Copy and paste ffmpeg.exe, ffplay.exe, and ffprobe.exe into a 
   directory in PATH, like `C:\Users\louie\AppData\Local\GitHubDesktop\bin` 
   on my computer
3. Now ffmpeg should work normally 

### Audicity for labeling
